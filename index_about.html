                <p>biofertilizers are not fertilizers. They are directly used for supply of nutrition to crop plants.
                    Microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and blue green algae are largely used as biofertilizers.
                    These organisms are added to the rhizosphere of the plant to enhance their activity in the soil.
                    They help the plants indirectly through better nitrogen fixation or improving the nutrient
                    availability in the soil. Their mode of action differs and can be applied alone or in combination.
